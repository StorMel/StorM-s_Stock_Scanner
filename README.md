code that scans a JSON file with all the Nasdaq stocks (if you got an updated one use that)
 - We narrowed it to market cap over 1 billion for better performance
 - main strategy is to find stocks close to their 150/200 SMAs for close stops and alerts on breakouts
 - added pine script to paste in TradingView for better analysis 
 - output is an Excel sheet with all the relevant data connected to TradingView with on-ticker links

enjoy :)
didnt bother to make the code look orgenized yet
